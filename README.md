Already registered App on Azure Portal.

## Usage

This node is using `Redirect Method` of msal  
Enter:

- `Scopes` :  e.g. **user.read**  or **<https://management.azure.com/.default>**...
- `Init URL` : Url that will lead to Azure Login: **/login2azure**  
- `Local Redirect URL` : RedirectUrl that will listen on Azure Login Response: **/redirect**  
**Note: On Azure Portal you have to add the complete REDIRECT URL !!!  
Running NR on `http://localhost:1880` then you have to add `http://localhost:1880/redirect` for your app in Azure Portal !  
This node will patch up the complete REDIRECT URL on its own and pass it to msal!**  

Node can receive `msg.update = true` object to do a silent renewal of token.  
Node will send msal processed response object. The included accessToken can be use to trigger http node to do REST call on Azure API  

## Config Node
